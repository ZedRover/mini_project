# Results Directory

This directory contains the output files generated by running the model training pipeline.

## How to Generate Results

Run the main training script:

```bash
python src/train_models.py
```

## Generated Files

After running the training pipeline, this directory will contain:

### metrics/
- `baseline_models_comparison.csv` - Comparison of all baseline models
- `outsample_evaluation.csv` - Evaluation results on holdout data
- `*_fold_details.csv` - Detailed metrics for each fold of each model

### figures/
- `baseline_models_comparison.png` - Bar chart comparing model performance
- `baseline_ic_boxplot.png` - Boxplot of IC distribution across folds
- `baseline_quantile_performance.png` - Quantile performance analysis
- `lasso_ic_pearson_heatmap.png` - Heatmap of LASSO IC across alphas and folds
- `lasso_ic_spearman_heatmap.png` - Heatmap of LASSO Spearman IC
- `lasso_stability_analysis.png` - Stability metrics across different alphas
- `lasso_*_heatmap.png` - Quantile IC heatmaps
- `outsample_*_scatter.png` - Prediction vs actual scatter plots

### lasso_analysis/
- `lasso_ic_*_fold_matrix.csv` - IC matrices for different metrics
- `lasso_stability_metrics.csv` - Stability analysis results
- `lasso_all_fold_details.csv` - Complete fold-level details
- `lasso_*_ic_pearson_fold_matrix.csv` - Quantile IC matrices

### training_report.txt
- Summary report of the entire training process

## Note

These files are excluded from version control (see `.gitignore`) because they are generated artifacts. To reproduce the results, simply run the training script as shown above.
